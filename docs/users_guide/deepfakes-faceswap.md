# Deepfakes Faceswap

This service uses [faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) to perform face swapping on videos.

It is part of our third party [DNN Model Services](https://github.com/singnet/dnn-model-services).

### Welcome

The service receives 2 videos URL as an input to train the model.

It returns a link (with an UID that can be used to make future requests to keep training/improving the same model).

With this link, users can check the progress of their requests in a dashboard.

### Whatâ€™s the point?

The service extracts frames from input videos (A and B) and use these frames to train a face swapping model.

With the trained model, the service converts the video A with a face from video B, generating a new video.

### How does it work?

The user must provide the following inputs in order to start the service and get a response:

Inputs:
  - `gRPC method`: faceswap.
  - `uid`: To keep training the same model (optional)
  - `video_a`: URL to Video A (30 FPS, max size 20Mb).
  - `video_b`: URL to Video B (30 FPS, max size 20Mb).
  - `model_url`: URL to a pre-trained model (max: 320Mb, optional).

Note: Each call will train the model with 3000 iterations.

You can use this service from [SingularityNET DApp](http://beta.singularitynet.io/).

You can also call the service from SingularityNET CLI (`snet`).

Assuming that you have an open channel to this service:

```
$ snet client call snet deepfakes-faceswap default_group faceswap '{"video_a": "http://snet-models.s3.amazonaws.com/bh/Deepfakes/ben.mp4", "video_b": "http://snet-models.s3.amazonaws.com/bh/Deepfakes/musk.mp4"}'
uid: "http://52.38.111.172:7006/dashboard?uid=c5b28d375b53e6107f05"
```
