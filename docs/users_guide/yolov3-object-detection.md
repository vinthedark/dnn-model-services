# Object Detection

This service uses [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to perform object detection on images.

It is part of our third party [DNN Model Services](https://github.com/singnet/dnn-model-services).

### Welcome

The service receives an image and uses it as an input for a pre-trained `YOLOv3` model.

The model can detect objects (80 classes) from [COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#overview).

### Whatâ€™s the point?

The service makes prediction using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

The service outputs an image with a bounding box for each object that it has predicted (and its confidence).

### How does it work?

The user must provide the following inputs in order to start the service and get a response:

Inputs:
  - `model`: DNN Model ("yolov3").
  - `img_path`: An image URL.
  - `confidence`: Confidence of object detection (between 0 and 1).

You can use this service from [SingularityNET DApp](http://beta.singularitynet.io/), clicking on `SNET/ObjectDetection`.

You can also call the service from SingularityNET CLI (`snet`).

Assuming that you have an open channel to this service:

```
$ snet client call snet yolov3-object-detection default_group detect '{"model": "yolov3", "img_path": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/amv-prod-cad-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/media/51/2017-10best-lead-photo-672628-s-original.jpg", "confidence": "0.5"}'
...
