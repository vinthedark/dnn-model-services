## Getting Started

For more details on how to publish and test a service, select it from the list below:

### Audio:
- [real-time-voice-cloning](services/real-time-voice-cloning) ([User's Guide](docs/users_guide/real-time-voice-cloning.md)) - This service uses Real-Time-Voice-Cloning to clone a voice from a 5 seconds audio file to generate arbitrary speech in real-time. [[Reference](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning)]
- [sound-spleeter](services/sound-spleeter) ([User's Guide](docs/users_guide/sound-spleeter.md)) - This service uses Deezer's Spleeter to perform source separation on audio files. [[Reference](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter)]
    ```
